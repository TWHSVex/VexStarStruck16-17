																																																																																	Gotta make you understand

																																																																																	Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down
																																																																																	Never gonna run around and desert you
																																																																																	Never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye
																																																																																	Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

																																																																																	We've known each other for so long
																																																																																	Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it
																																																																																	Inside we both know what's been going on
																																																																																	We know the game and we're gonna play it

																																																																																	And if you ask me how I'm feeling
																																																																																	Don't tell me you're too blind to see

																																																																																	Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down
																																																																																	Never gonna run around and desert you
																																																																																	Never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye
